# Application Process Details to CSV using Poweershell Scripting
A powershell Script is used to generate application process details into a csv file


Storing data in a structured way is important when that data will be read by a computer. One of the easiest ways to put data into an easy-to-read format is with a comma-separated value (CSV) file. A CSV file can just be thought of like a spreadsheet without all the bells and whistles. A CSV file consists of a line of headers to indicate column name and subsequent values for each column all separated by a comma.
